#### But Why

When I first started using the Webui, I did not change the **File format** from `.png`, which resulted in a significant amount of storage being used. Over the past year or so, I've accumulated around 56 GB of outputs. Using this Extension to convert from `.png` to `.webp`, took around 10 min and reduced the storage usage by about half~
